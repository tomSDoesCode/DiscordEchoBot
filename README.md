## Description
This is the python code for hosting the Discord EchoBot. This bot is intented to be added to a server and have the server's members use the __!join__ command to make it join either their currently occupied voice channel or a specified channel. Then they can use the __!say_register__ command which will take a member of the server. Once one or more members have been registered and the bot is in a voice channel it will play text-to-speech whenever the registered users sends a message in any text channel the bot has access to.
## TODO list
+ add auto disconnect

+ add better user state management

+ setup docker image
